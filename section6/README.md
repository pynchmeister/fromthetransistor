Section 6: Browser: Coming online -- 1 week
Building a TCP stack(C, 500) -- Probably coded in the kernel, integrate the ethernet driver into the kernel. Add support for networking syscalls to kernel. (send, recv, bind, connect)
telnetd, the power of being multiprocess(C, 50) -- Written in C, user can connect multiple times with telnet. Really just a bind shell.

So about that web(C, 500+) -- A “nice” text based web browser, using ANSI and terminal niceness. Dynamically linked and nice, nice as you want.
